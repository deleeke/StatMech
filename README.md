This repository contains programs from originated from an on-line course
taught by Werner Krauth.

Mr. Krauth provided sample code that demonstrated an algorithm, and I have expanded upon
these samples to create programs that include features such as
writing the results to a file, or prompting a user
to enter input and are designed to handle inappropriate input.

I hope to get into some visualization too!
